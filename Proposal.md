# Aims of the experiment and scientific background
X-ray grating interferometry (GI) is the most promising technique for phase-contrast imaging on conventional X-ray tubes [1,2]. It can be operated using polychromatic and diverged laboratory sources, making it an encouraging method for medical imaging applicable in clinics. Its ability to detect not only the absorption signal, but also the phase and scattering contrast makes it especially suitable to differentiate between different soft tissue types and for cancer detection [3].

Previous work based on KNMF proposals demonstrated the feasibility of a Talbot-Lau interferometer with a fan-beam geometry and bent gratings to match the divergence of the beam, as well as its feasibility at energies above 30 keV [4, Matteo].

On promising application for medical phase contrast imaging is mammography, and ongoing research aims to optimize GI based mammography setups for highest soft tissue sensitivity at lowest possible dose [Refs! Stampanoni2011, ]. Though the dose and absorption contrast decreases rapidly with higher energies, the phase contrast decrease as well, albeit slower, making a theoretical optimal compromise between dose and signal strength not obvious. Additionally, with increasing energy Compton scattering becomes more prominent, which leads to a further reduction in contrast and sensitivity [ref for Compton?].
Taking further into account the grating imperfections and measurement inaccuracy of the setup, an experimental approach to determine the effects of higher energies with respect to dose and signal strength is preferable.

The present proposal aims to experimentally compare two setups designed for medical relevant energies of 30 keV and 45 keV with respect to soft tissue sensitivity and differentiation. Theoretical investigations of the contrast decrease due to Compton scattering will be compared to the experimental results. The dose will be measured as well, to put the image quality and tissue sensitivity into a clinical relevant perspective. The gratings will be mounted bent, to accommodate the beam divergence.  

# Experimental method
The Talbot-Lau interferometer consists of three gratings. The absorption grating G0 generates an array of individually coherent lines from an incoherent source such as a table-top X-ray tube.
The phase grating G1 shifts the phase of the wave by π at periodic intervals and generates an interference pattern downstream due to the Talbot effect.
Finally, the second absorption grating G2 is used to measure the interference fringes. It allows measuring the intensity reduction, lateral displacement and visibility of the fringes, yielding the absorption, differential phase and scattering signals.

The grating parameters are optimized to compare the achievable visibility, soft tissue sensitivity and dosimetry for two different design energies. To include the effects of grating imperfections we specifically request the fabrication of 2 G0s and G2s, even though the specifications are the same. To be able to bent G0 to a small radius, the wafer substrate should be Titanium.

Two sets of gratings are required, compatible with 30 keV and 45 keV. All gratings should have a pitch of 6 μm and a duty cycle of 0.5. The dimensions of all gratings are 7 cm x 7 cm.
The absorption gratings G0 and G2 should have a height of 120 μm, the phase gratings G1 should have a height of 10.44 μm and 15.72 μm.
To bent G0 at a small radius the wafer substrate should be titanium. To lower the aspect ratio for G1 the material should be nickel.
All specifications are summarized in the following table

| Grating type | Energy (keV) | Structure height (μm) | Pitch (μm)/duty cycle | Grating size | Material | Wafer material |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| G0 (absorption) | 30 | 120 | 6/0.5 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Gold | Titanium |
| G0 (absorption) | 45 | 120 | 6/0.5 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Gold | Titanium |
| G1 (phase) | 30 | 10.44   | 6/0.5 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Nickel | Silicon/Nickel? | 
| G1 (phase) | 45 | 15.72 | 6/0.5 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Nickel | Silicon/Nickel? |
| G2 (absorption) | 30 | 120 | 6/0.5 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Gold | Silicon | 
| G2 (absorption) | 45 | 120 | 6/0.5 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Gold | Silicon | 

# Expected results
Preliminary results on a table-top setup designed for lower energies show the superiority of phase contrast to absorption contrast with respect to soft tissue and cancer detection. However, this setup was designed for a proof of principle and was not optimized with respect to dose. The new setups aim to optimize the dose with respect to signal strength, and investigate the effects of Compton scattering at higher energies.
