# Aims of the experiment and scientific background
X-ray grating interferometry (GI) is a promising technique for
phase-contrast imaging on conventional X-ray tubes [1,2]. It can be operated
using polychromatic and diverging laboratory sources, making it an
encouraging method for medical imaging applicable in clinics. Its ability to
detect not only the absorption signal, but also the phase and scattering
contrasts makes it especially suitable for soft tissue differentiation and
cancer detection [3].

Previous work based on KNMF proposals demonstrated the feasibility of a
Talbot-Lau interferometer with a fan-beam geometry and bent gratings on
special titanium substrates to match the divergence of the beam, as well as
its feasibility at energies above 30 keV [4].

One promising application for medical phase contrast imaging is mammography,
and ongoing research aims to optimize GI based mammography setups for
highest soft tissue sensitivity at lowest possible dose [5].
Widespread applicability of tomography for mammography screenings is
currently limited by dose concerns. The enhanced sensitivity of the
phase interaction to soft tissues could be a paradigm shift in making the
technology available even for routine checkups. Moreover, there is less need
to generate contrast with strongly absorbed low energy photons, and a
better compromise between dose and contrast can be reached for energies
slightly above current mammography setups [6].

The present proposal aims to experimentally compare two setups designed for
such medically relevant energies of 30 keV and 45 keV with respect to soft tissue
sensitivity and differentiation. Theoretical investigations of the effects
of Compton scattering will be compared to the experimental
results. The dose will be measured as well, to put the image quality and
tissue sensitivity into a clinical relevant perspective. The gratings will
be bent, to accommodate the beam divergence.  

# Experimental method
The Talbot-Lau interferometer consists of three gratings. The absorption
grating G0 generates an array of individually coherent lines from an
incoherent source such as a table-top X-ray tube. The phase grating G1
shifts the phase of the wave by π at periodic intervals and generates an
interference pattern downstream due to the Talbot effect. Finally, the
second absorption grating G2 is used to measure the interference fringes. It
allows measuring the intensity reduction, lateral displacement and
visibility of the fringes, yielding the absorption, differential phase and
scattering signals.

The grating parameters are optimized to compare the achievable visibility,
soft tissue sensitivity and dosimetry for two different design energies.

Two sets of gratings are required, compatible with a design energy of 30 keV
and 45 keV. All gratings should have a pitch of 6 μm and a duty cycle of
0.5. The dimensions of all gratings are 7 cm x 7 cm. G0s, being close to the
source can be smaller, down to 3 cm x 3 cm. The absorption gratings G0 and
G2 should have a height of 120 μm, the phase gratings G1 should have a
height of 10.44 μm and 15.72 μm. To bent G0 at a small radius the wafer
substrate should be titanium. To lower the aspect ratio for G1 the material
should be nickel. All specifications are summarized in the following table

| Grating type | Energy (keV) | Structure height (μm) | Grating size | Material | Wafer material |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| G0 (absorption) | 30 | 120 | 3 cm x 3 cm | Gold | Titanium |
| G0 (absorption) | 45 | 120 | 3 cm x 3 cm | Gold | Titanium |
| G1 (phase) | 30 | 10.44   | 7 cm x 7 cm | Nickel | Nickel | 
| G1 (phase) | 45 | 15.72 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Nickel | Nickel |
| G2 (absorption) | 30 | 120 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Gold | Silicon | 
| G2 (absorption) | 45 | 120 | 7 cm x 7 cm | Gold | Silicon | 

# Expected results
Preliminary results on a table-top setup designed for lower energies show
the superiority of phase contrast to absorption contrast with respect to
soft tissue and cancer detection. However, this setup was designed for a
proof of principle and was not optimized with respect to dose. The new
setups aim to optimize the dose with respect to signal strength, and
investigate the effects of Compton scattering at higher energies on a
tomography-ready setup.
